# LEGO Smart Home and Home Controller Lite UI

This simplified version of Raspberry Pi House code samples and the home controller user-interface are written for blog tutorials.

The actual code is *not* the actual code used for the LEGO house displayed at PubNub office window display. We (Tomomi Imura and Bhavana Sninivas) re-created a circuit for each component, and re-wrote the code in python to publish as easy-to-follow tutorials.
